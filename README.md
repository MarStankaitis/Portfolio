## About me
I am a highly motivated ex-recruitment project specialist, who has recently decided to take on a challenge and change careers to become a Software Tester. This career path has interested me for quite a while, thus after gaining a fundamental understanding of software testing I am eager to contribute my skills and dedication to delivering high-quality and timely work to help improve software quality.

My previous experience, which at the moment, mostly includes several projects completed on freelancing platforms such as uTest, demonstrates my growing practical experience in the field and drive to keep developing as a software tester. During these projects, I have had the chance to execute predetermined test cases, do exploratory testing, write user reviews, and file bug reports according to specific guidelines.

In this portfolio, I would like to share my testing knowledge and technical skills, which I gained during a rigorous 80-hour software testing course at CodeAcademy, through self-learning online, and several completed projects. I am determined to keep learning and developing in this field. This is why I am looking for a junior position in software testing
